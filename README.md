# Serendipity-aware Career Recommendation System

The **Serendipity-aware Career Recommendation System** enhances career decision-making by combining predictive machine learning models with serendipitous suggestions. It not only recommends careers based on user preferences, skills, and aptitude but also introduces unexpected yet relevant career options to broaden the user's exploration space.

Built using Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn, the system leverages Random Forest for primary predictions and uses TF-IDF with Cosine Similarity to power serendipity-based recommendations.
